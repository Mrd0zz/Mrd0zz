      <div class="content"><p>I recently passed the PNPT exam and in this article I will share my views on the exam, course material and if you should take it or not.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<ul>
<li>I am an InfoSec Engineer and my day-to-day activities doesn’t include anything related to pentesting. I have played CTFs in the past and solved machines on HTB &amp; THM. So, I have some knowledge about penetration testing limited to mentioned platforms. I can say this was my first time dealing with a penetration test followed by a professionally crafted report and 15 min debrief session.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-course-material">The Course Material</h2>
<ul>
<li>The learning material provided by TCM Security includes five extensive courses - Practical Ethical Hacking, Windows Privilege Escalation, Linux Privilege Escalation, Open-Source Intelligence, External Pentest Playbook. I will describe each course in detail below. PEH, OSINT and EPP are sufficient to pass the exam, but in my opinion if you&rsquo;re new to pentesting field you should complete all these 5 courses and take detailed notes as WPE and LPE will give you more understanding of how things work and what other exploitation techniques are there. As I had knowledge about linux and windows priv esc I left out these courses.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="1-practical-ethical-hacking">1. Practical Ethical Hacking</h4>
<ul>
<li>This is the heart of this course covering most of the basics of penetration testing and ethical hacking. It also included basics of networking, linux and python scripting. It explains step-by-step the ethical hacker&rsquo;s methodology by going through each phases like reconnaissance, scanning &amp; enumeration, exploitation, post exploitation, maintaining access and most important part - Report writing. To try your methodology there are 5 capstone challenges available with walkthoughs if you stuck on something. The best part I liked about this course was that we have to setup our own vulnerable AD environment giving an insight on how AD functions and how we can leverage these misconfigurations to our benefit. Heath also showcases 3 case studies related to AD which were very good and gives real word example how vulnerable organizations actually are. The course also contains Web application enumeration and exploitation which is not required for PNPT but helpful if you&rsquo;re preparing for another certifications (like eWPT, OSCP).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2-osint">2. OSINT</h4>
<ul>
<li>As I had previous experience playing CTFs and that includes OSINT section, so this was easy for me to follow along. It was a comprehensive course on OSINT and covered many tools and techniques to gather lot of data about someone just only by what is available online.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="3-external-pentest-playbook">3. External Pentest Playbook</h4>
<ul>
<li>This course focused on external pentest tactics and methodology giving an insight on how actual penetration tests are carried out in real world. It covers all the documentation (like RoE), and communication with the interested parties. It also gives tips on a professional report and checklists to follow during a pentest.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="preparation-before-the-exam">Preparation before the exam</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>After completing the course I did two machines from Tryhackme - <a href="https://tryhackme.com/r/room/resetui">Reset</a> and <a href="https://tryhackme.com/r/room/badbyte">Badbyte</a>. Badbyte covers port forwarding which was crucial for this exam.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also I completed all the attacks mentioned in PEH 2-3 times to get familiar with AD attacks and made a sample pentest report just like the one provided in the material.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-exam">The Exam</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can directly start the exam just by clicking a button and there is no need of scheduling it. The exam is of <em>10 hours</em> in which you have to answer <em>50 questions</em> which will consist of MCQ, Short-answer type questions all related to the environment you’re testing. Keep in mind this is not a CTF style exam. You will also get access to in-browser kali machine connected to a guacamole server with all the tools and wordlists pre-installed in the machine. NOTE: The machine does not have access to outside internet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before starting you are given the Letter of Engagement stating the Scope and scenario for the pentest. You then have full 10 hours to answer the questions and in order to pass you need <code>at least 70% correct answers</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The course material covers everything that is asked in the exam but I still required a little bit of researching during the exam. Enumeration is the key and knowing how to chain and link vulnerabilities is an advantage which is needed to build up a good methodology.  API services testing was new for me and remembering the course videos and labs helped in this case.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="should-you-do-it">Should you do it</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Anyone starting their career in cybersecurity / penetration testing / can take this course as it gives an introduction about the OWASP TOP 10 and covers everything from basic level which is definitely relevant in today’s environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My advice is - &ldquo;just don’t go for the sake of certification but learn the concepts about how web apps work and what vulnerabilities can arise in them&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have questions please reach out to me. I will be happy to answer your questions.</p></div>
